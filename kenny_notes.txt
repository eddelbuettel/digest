Notes:

Compared to fastdigest:
 - Removed fun / ref_serializer. These aren't necessary but could be added later.
 - Changed seeds to 0 (seems to be consistent with other implementations).
 - I haven't been able to match any other spooky hashes (see linktofdissue) but I also haven't been able to find a streaming example. May have to add a skip argument?
