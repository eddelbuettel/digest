Title: Create Compact Hash Digests of R Objects
Description: Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation
    of hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256,
    crc32, xxhash and murmurhash algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R
    language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based
    message authentication code.
    .
    The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1
    and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2,
    and the crc32 algorithm is described in
    ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.
    .
    For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone
    implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code
    from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron
    D. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is used.
    For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used.
    .
    Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for
    cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely
    tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
