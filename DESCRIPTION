Title: Create cryptographic hash digests of R objects
Description: The digest package provides functions for the creation of
	`hash' digests of arbitrary R objects using the md5, sha-1, sha-256 
        and crc32 algorithms permitting easy comparison of R language objects. 
	The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the SHA-1 
        and SHA-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, 
        and the crc32 algorithm is described in 
        ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.
        For md5, sha-1 and sha-256, this packages uses small standalone 
	C implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For
	crc32, code from the zlib library is used.
        .
	Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for 
	cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely 
        tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
